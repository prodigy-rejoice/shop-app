## Getting Started

This project is HNG Task 1 in the Mobile Development Stack.
It is a simple shopping app that displays a list of products/items (statically) in a shop and a checkout screen.

Description:
A bottom navigation bar that consists of 2 buttons - Products and Checkout items.

Products displays the list of products/items, Checkout displays the products added for checkout.

Also, I added a functionality to add and remove items to the Checkout (removal of items is achieved using Dismissible Widgets and delete icon)..

And then, there is a button that navigates to an Order Successful screen from the Checkout screen.

Below are screenshots of the app:
