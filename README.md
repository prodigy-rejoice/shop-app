# shop_app

A Simple Shopping App Made With Flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is HNG Task 1 in the Mobile Development Stack. 
It is a simple shopping app that displays a list of products/items (statically) in a shop and a checkout screen.

Description: 
A bottom navigation bar that consists of 2 buttons - Products and Checkout items.

Products displays the list of products/items, Checkout displays the products added for checkout.

Also, I added a functionality to add and remove items to the Checkout (removal of items is achieved using Dismissible Widgets)..

And then, there is a button that navigates to an Order Successful screen from the Checkout screen.

I used setState to manage the app's state throughout. setState and state lifting handles the flow of the app.
